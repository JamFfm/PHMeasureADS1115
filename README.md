# PHMeasureADS1115 add-on for CraftBeerPi 3

*Craftbeerpi3* sensor for measuring ph values.
Using the ADS115 A/D via I2C connection


# How to Install

1. Load the NEXTIONDisplay addin from the CraftbeerPi3 addin section (not jet available).

    Workaround:

    Key in in the command box of Raspi

    
    `git clone https://github.com/JamFfm/PHMeasureADS1115.git -b master --single-branch /home/pi/craftbeerpi3/modules/plugins/PHMeasureADS1115   
    `
    
    
A update is done by the same commands unless it is not in the oficial add on list.

But first you have to delete the Folder

`sudo rm -r /home/pi/craftbeerpi3/modules/plugins/PHMeasureADS1115/`

3. Reboot at least CBPi3


# What for?

The pH has got an influence on the beer taste. Please inform yourself in the literature.
Usually the mash will be between 4.5pH and 5.8pH.

>**The target pH for the mash usually should be between 5.3pH and 5.7pH**

Therefore it is important to know the pH of the mash.

# Advantages

- Works much more stable/precise like the MCP3008 IC Module.
- I2C connection is very easy to handle. 
- The driver is build in. No need to install software modules.
- This is the supposed ADS on the CBPi Extentionboard 3 (just solder ADS, Levelshifter and connect probe board with screwterminals)

**The probe board is an analog sensor. RaspberryPi can read only digital sensors.
Therefore you need an analog/digital converter like the ADS1115 (16Bit)**

# How to connect

![Test Graph](https://github.com/JamFfm/PHMeasure/blob/master/RaspberryPiPHSensorSteckplatine.png "Example wiring, not campatible with code. Have a look at Software SPI")
Be aware that you use the **connections below** if you don't change the code. Not use the MCP3008 connections in the picture!
**But use the Picture to wire the levelshifter and the probe-board. In this picture channel 0 is connected**

## Connect I2C

To connect the ADS1115 to the Raspberry Pi use the following connections:

- ADS GND   to RASPI GND 
- ADS VDD   to RASPI 5v 
- ADS SCL   to RASPI SCL (daisychain possible)
- ADS SCA   to RASPI SCA (daisychain possible)
- Address   have a look at the specs of ADS1115 for changing adress
- Alert     have a look at the specs of ADS1115 for Alert events
- A0        to Po of the PhMeasure Board. Put a level shifter 5v/3,3v inbetween because the Raspi pin can only stand 3.3v

# Board description

![Test Graph](https://github.com/JamFfm/PHMeasure/blob/master/1.0x0.jpg "powerampfilter")



* BNC plug: Where you put the probe. It seems to work with any probe with a calibration difference.

* Pin To: Should be the temperature but I can't make it works.
* Pin Do: High/Low 3.3v adjustable limit.
* Pin G/GND: Probe ground. It may be useful when the ground is not the same as your Raspi. In fact I use the ground of the Raspi.
  In some circumstances the ground voltage of the liquid to measure can be different.
* Pin G/GND: Power ground (ex. Raspi).
* Pin V+/VCC: Input power 5V DC (direct from Raspi).
* Blue potentiometer close to BNC: pH offset.
* Blue potentiometer close to pins: limit adjustment.
* Black component with 103 printed (not the one between potentiometers): thermistor for temperature compensation.

# Calibration: this section is invalid and has to be corrected

## The offset

The offset is the shifting of all pH values to a specific voltage range. If a pH 7 output a voltage of 2.2v and pH 8 a voltage of 2.1v, then a shift of +0.3v move the pH 7 to 2.5v and the pH 8 to 2.4v. 


This can be done on the board or via software but it's probably easyer on the board because it's probe independant and there are less programming to do.


Connect GND (both) to Raspi GND and and Vcc to Raspi 5v. Please use a levelshifter to avoid damage at the GPIO which only support 3.3v. 

Remove the probe and do a short circuit between the the small BNC hole and the external part of BNC. 

Put a voltmeter to measure the voltage between GND and Po. Adjust the pot (close BNC) until the output is 2.5v. 

Now the pH 7 have an exact value of 2.5v (511 with analogRead function) because the probe will output 0 millivolt.

## The steps

Now you need one or more buffer solutions depending the range and precision you want. Ideally you should know the range of the measure you want to do with your system. 

I use water (upcoming beer) between pH 5 and pH 7, then I choose the buffer 4.01 (and 6.86 to verify my stuff). If you usually measure pH between 8 and 10 choose buffer 9.18 (eventually 6.86 also).


Connect the (clean) probe and put it in the buffer then let it stabilize for a minute. You know it's stable when it goes up and down (3.04 then 3.05 then 3.03 then 3.04). Take note of the voltmeter value, in my example it's 3.05v.

## Unit per step

The PH_step calculation is quite simple. You take the difference between the two known voltage, in my example 2.5v@pH7 and 3.05v@pH4.01 which is -0.55v. 

It's the voltage range equivalent of the pH range from 7 to 4.01, which is 2.99 pH units. A small division of the voltage by pH units gives you a volts per pH number (0,1839... in my case).

The PH_probe is calculated by taking the known pH 7 voltage (2.5v) where we add some PH_step to match the probe voltage. This means that a pH of 8 have a voltage value of 2.5v (pH 7) + 0.1839 (1 unit/step); pH 9 then is 2.5v + 0.1839 + 0.1839 = 2.87v.

To determine the Unit per Step (=PH_step in formula) is important to know.

# Finally the code

16 Bit = 32767 possible values between 0V and Gain max V and
32767 possible values between -Gain max V and 0v

With gain 1 (+-4.096V)
print('%d - %.5f V'% (value, float(value)*4.096/32768.0))
voltage = measure * 4.096 / 32768 ; //classic digital to voltage conversion

// PH_step = (voltage@PH7 - voltage@PH4) / (PH7 - PH4) = (2.5-3.05) / (7-4) = (-.55/2.99) = -0.1839....

// PH_probe = PH7 - ((voltage@PH7 - voltage@probe) / PH_step)

phvalue = 7 + ((2.5 - voltage) / *0.1839* )

# Usage

Use this sensor as any other sensor in Craftbeerpi 3.
The Digit and Voltage values can help to calibrate. They are not needed for pH measurement.
The main calibaration is already described above. 

Keep in mind that it takes several minutes to get the right pH value.

When using in the rotating mash no stable values are shown but in a probe of mash (ex. a glass) it was very stable.
Values matched with a other pH measurement tool.

Please do changes of the formula in the code of the file "__init__.py". 
It is situated in the folder

home/pi/craftbeerpi3/modules/plugins/PHMeasureADS1115/

According the parameters of the probe it can be situated in max 80°C liquid but not for longtime.
I never tryed that until now.

# Parameter

## Name
Text as You want

## Type
Name of the pH Sensor Modul like PHSensorADS1x15

## ADS1x15 Address
this is the I2C address of the ADS module.
Default ist 0x48.
If there are two or more modules with the same address you can choose a different address.
This means you have to solder connections in a different way. Have a look in the ADS1x15-datasheed.
This parameter Is rarely used. So in most cases entering 0x48 will do it.

## ADS1x15 Channel
this is the channel you want to read. There are up to 4 channels called A0-A3.
You have to connect the sensor to the channel.

## ADS1x15 Gain
this is the amplifier of the ADS module.
These are the selectible ranges:

For example: Choose a gain of 1 for reading voltages from 0 to 4.09V.
this will be the right parameter für the pH probe.

Or pick a different gain to change the range of voltages that are read:
- 2/3 = +/-6.144V     we use 0 for this range
-   1 = +/-4.096V
-   2 = +/-2.048V
-   4 = +/-1.024V
-   8 = +/-0.512V
-  16 = +/-0.256V

See table 3 in the ADS1015/ADS1115 datasheet for more info on gain.

If you have no idea enter 1.

## Data Type

- Digit:  
This shows the value of the MCP 3008 and runs from 0-1024.
This is the basic of all measurement.


- Voltage: 
This shows the calculated value of the Voltage measurement.
Voltage = 5 / 1024.0 * Digit
5 is the basic voltage of the Board
This means 1024 digit is equal to 5V.


- pH Value: 
This shows the calculated value of the pH measurment.
phvalue = 7 + ((2.532 - voltage) / *0.1839* )
As discribed above the *0.1839* has to be adopted in the code.

Maybe the 2.532 has to be adopted to the voltage value you measure with the short circuit between the the small BNC hole and the external part of BNC.


# Hint

You can easily change the addon for different analog sensors.

There are only some lines to change. 

I use the ADS115 in a CraftBeerPi Extensionboard 3 in combination with a livel shifter

# Known Problems
- This is just to show how to use the ADS1115 to show values
- You hae to find out the right parameter to show the right voltage values and the right pH values
- When using in the rotating mash no stable values are shown 
- Wrong spelling
- no temperature calibration
